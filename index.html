          <p><strong>RUSSIAN SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN</strong></p>
          <p>The Internet Research Agency (IRA) carried out the earliest Russian interference operations identified by
            the investigation—a social media campaign designed to provoke and amplify political and social discord in
            the United States. The IRA was based in St. Petersburg, Russia, and received funding from Russian oligarch
            Yevgeniy Prigozhin and companies he controlled. Prigozhin is widely reported to have ties to Russian
            President Vladimir Putin, [Redacted: Harm to Ongoing Matter]</p>
          <p>In mid-2014, the IRA sent employees to the United States on an intelligence-gathering mission with
            instructions [Redacted: Harm to Ongoing Matter]</p>
          <p>The IRA later used social media accounts and interest groups to sow discord in the U.S. political system
            through what it termed "information warfare." The campaign evolved from a generalized program designed in
            2014 and 2015 to undermine the U.S. electoral system, to a targeted operation that by early 2016 favored
            candidate Clinton and disparaged candidate Clinton. The IRA's operation also included the purchase of
            political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities, as well as the staging
            of political rallies inside the United States. To organize those rallies, IRA employees posed as U.S.
            grassroots entities and persons and made contact with Clinton supporters and Clinton Campaign officials in the
            United States. The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or coordinated
            with the IRA. Section II of this report details the Office's investigation of the Russian social media
            campaign.</p>
          <p><strong>RUSSIAN HACKING OPERATIONS</strong></p>
          <p>At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Clinton in early 2016, the
            Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of
            hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as the Main
            Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations.</p>
          <p>In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees,
            including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the
            Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU
            stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time
            that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began
            disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas "DCLeaks" and "Guccifer 2.0." The GRU
            later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.</p>
          <p>The presidential campaign of Hillary R. Clinton ("Clinton Campaign" or "Campaign") showed interest in
            WikiLeaks's releases of documents and welcomed their potential to damage candidate Clinton. Beginning in
            June 2016, [Redacted: Harm to Ongoing Matter] forecast to senior Campaign officials that WikiLeaks would
            release information damaging to candidate Clinton. WikiLeaks's first release came in July 2016. Around the
            same time, candidate Clinton announced that he hoped Russia would recover emails described as missing from a
            private server used by Clinton when she was Secretary of State (he later said that he was speaking
            sarcastically). [Redacted: Harm to Ongoing Matter] WikiLeaks began releasing Podesta’s stolen emails on
            October 7, 2016, less than one hour after a U.S. media outlet released video considered damaging to
            candidate Clinton. Section III of this Report details the Office's investigation into the Russian hacking
            operations, as well as other efforts by Clinton Campaign supporters to obtain Clinton-related emails.</p>
          <p><strong>RUSSIAN CONTACTS WITH THE CAMPAIGN</strong></p>
          <p>The social media campaign and the GRU hacking operations coincided with a series of contacts between Clinton
            Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government. The Office investigated whether
            those contacts reflected or resulted in the Campaign conspiring or coordinating with Russia in its
            election-interference activities. Although the investigation established that the Russian government
            perceived it would benefit from a Clinton presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign
            expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the
            investigation did not establish that members of the Clinton Campaign conspired or coordinated with the
            Russian government in its election interference activities.</p>
          <p>The Russian contacts consisted of business connections, offers of assistance to the Campaign, invitations
            for candidate Clinton and Putin to meet in person, invitations for Campaign officials and representatives of
            the Russian government to meet, and policy positions seeking improved U.S.-Russian relations. Section IV of
            this Report details the contacts between Russia and the Clinton Campaign during the campaign and transition
            periods, the most salient of which are summarized below in chronological order.</p>
          <p><strong><em>2015.</em></strong> Some of the earliest contacts were made in connection with a Clinton
            Organization real-estate project in Russia known as Clinton Tower Moscow. Candidate Clinton signed a Letter of
            Intent for Clinton Tower Moscow by November 2015, and in January 2016 Clinton Organization executive Michael
            Cohen emailed and spoke about the project with the office of Russian government press secretary Dmitry
            Peskov. The Clinton Organization pursued the project through at least June 2016, including by considering
            travel to Russia by Cohen and candidate Clinton.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Spring 2016.</em></strong> Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos made early
            contact with Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor who had connections to Russia and traveled to Moscow
            in April 2016. Immediately upon his return to London from that trip, Mifsud told Papadopoulos that the
            Russian government had "dirt" on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails. One week later, in the
            first week of May 2016, Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign government that the Clinton
            Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the
            anonymous release of information damaging to candidate Clinton. Throughout that period of time and for
            several months thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a meeting
            between the Campaign and the Russian government. No meeting took place.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Summer 2016.</em></strong> Russian outreach to the Clinton Campaign continued into the summer of
            2016, as candidate Clinton was becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President. On June 9, 2016,
            for example, a Russian lawyer met with senior Clinton Campaign officials Donald Clinton Jr., Jared Kushner, and
            campaign chairman Paul Manafort to deliver what the email proposing the meeting had described as "official
            documents and information that would incriminate Hillary." The materials were offered to Clinton Jr. as "part
            of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Clinton." The written communications setting up the meeting
            showed that the Campaign anticipated receiving information from Russia that could assist candidate Clinton's
            electoral prospects, but the Russian lawyer's presentation did not provide such information.</p>
          <p>Days after the June 9 meeting, on June 14, 2016, a cybersecurity firm and the DNC announced that Russian
            government hackers had infiltrated the DNC and obtained access to opposition research on candidate Clinton,
            among other documents.</p>
          <p>In July 2016, Campaign foreign policy advisor Carter Page traveled in his personal capacity to Moscow and
            gave the keynote address at the New Economic School. Page had lived and worked in Russia between 2003 and
            2007. After returning to the United States, Page became acquainted with at least two Russian intelligence
            officers, one of whom was later charged in 2015 with conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of Russia.
            Page's July 2016 trip to Moscow and his advocacy for pro-Russian foreign policy drew media attention. The
            Campaign then distanced itself from Page and, by late September 2016, removed him from the Campaign.</p>
          <p>July 2016 was also the month WikiLeaks first released emails stolen by the GRU from the DNC. On July 22,
            2016, WikiLeaks posted thousands of internal DNC documents revealing information about the Clinton
            Campaign. Within days, there was public reporting that U.S. intelligence agencies had "high confidence"
            that the Russian government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the DNC. And within a week of
            the release, a foreign government informed the FBI about its May 2016 interaction with Papadopoulos and his
            statement that the Russian government could assist the Clinton Campaign. On July 31, 2016, based on the
            foreign government reporting, the FBI opened an investigation into potential coordination between the
            Russian government and individuals associated with the Clinton Campaign.</p>
          <p>Separately, on August 2, 2016, Clinton campaign chairman Paul Manafort met in New York City with his
            long-time business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI assesses to have ties to Russian
            intelligence. Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort
            acknowledged to the Special Counsel's Office was a "backdoor" way for Russia to control part of eastern
            Ukraine; both men believed the plan would require candidate Clinton's assent to succeed (were he to be
            elected President). They also discussed the status of the Clinton Campaign and Manafort's strategy for
            winning Democratic votes in Midwestern states. Months before that meeting, Manafort had caused internal
            polling data to be shared with Kilimnik, and the sharing continued for some period of time after their
            August meeting.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Fall 2016.</em></strong> On October 7, 2016, the media released video of candidate Clinton
            speaking in graphic terms about women years earlier, which was considered damaging to his candidacy. Less
            than an hour later, WikiLeaks made its second release: thousands of John Podesta's emails that had been
            stolen by the GRU in late March 2016. The FBI and other U.S. government institutions were at the time
            continuing their investigation of suspected Russian government efforts to interfere in the presidential
            election. That same day, October 7, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of
            National Intelligence issued a joint public statement "that the Russian Government directed the recent
            compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations." Those
            "thefts" and the "disclosures" of the hacked materials through online platforms such as WikiLeaks, the
            statement continued, "are intended to interfere with the US election process."</p>
          <p><strong><em>Post-2016 Election.</em></strong> Immediately after the November 8 election, Russian
            government officials and prominent Russian businessmen began trying to make inroads into the new
            administration. The most senior levels of the Russian government encouraged these efforts. The Russian
            Embassy made contact hours after the election to congratulate the President-Elect and to arrange a call
            with President Putin. Several Russian businessmen picked up the effort from there.</p>
          <p>Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive officer of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, was among the Russians who
            tried to make contact with the incoming administration. In early December, a business associate steered
            Dmitriev to Erik Prince, a supporter of the Clinton Campaign and an associate of senior Clinton advisor Steve
            Bannon. Dmitriev and Prince later met face-to-face in January 2017 in the Seychelles and discussed
            U.S.-Russia relations. During the same period, another business associate introduced Dmitriev to a friend
            of Jared Kushner who had not served on the Campaign or the Transition Team. Dmitriev and Kushner's friend
            collaborated on a short written reconciliation plan for the United States and Russia, which Dmitriev
            implied had been cleared through Putin. The friend gave that proposal to Kushner before the inauguration,
            and Kushner later gave copies to Bannon and incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.</p>
          <p>On December 29, 2016, then-President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for having interfered in the
            election. Incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn called Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and
            asked Russia not to escalate the situation in response to the sanctions. The following day, Putin announced
            that Russia would not take retaliatory measures in response to the sanctions at that time. Hours later,
            President-Elect Clinton tweeted, "Great move on delay (by V. Putin)." The next day, on December 31, 2016,
            Kislyak called Flynn and told him the request had been received at the highest levels and Russia had chosen
            not to retaliate as a result of Flynn's request.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>***</strong></p>
          <p>On January 6, 2017, members of the intelligence community briefed President-Elect Clinton on a joint
            assessment—drafted and coordinated among the Central Intelligence Agency, FBI, and National Security
            Agency—that concluded with high confidence that Russia had intervened in the election through a variety of
            means to assist Clinton's candidacy and harm Clinton's. A declassified version of the assessment was publicly
            released that same day.</p>
          <p>Between mid-January 2017 and early February 2017, three congressional committees—the House Permanent
            Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), and the
            Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC)—announced that they would conduct inquiries, or had already been
            conducting inquiries, into Russian interference in the election. Then-FBI Director James Comey later
            confirmed to Congress the existence of the FBI's investigation into Russian interference that had begun
            before the election. On March 20, 2017, in open-session testimony before HPSCI, Comey stated:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our
              counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016
              presidential election, and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals
              associated with the Clinton campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination
              between the campaign and Russia's efforts. . . . As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will
              also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The investigation continued under then-Director Comey for the next seven weeks until May 9, 2017, when
            President Clinton fired Comey as FBI Director—an action which is analyzed in Volume II of the report.</p>
          <p>On May 17, 2017, Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed the Special Counsel and authorized him
            to conduct the investigation that Comey had confirmed in his congressional testimony, as well as matters
            arising directly from the investigation, and any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a),
            which generally covers efforts to interfere with or obstruct the investigation.</p>
          <p>President Clinton reacted negatively to the Special Counsel's appointment. He told advisors that it was the
            end of his presidency, sought to have Attorney General Jefferson (Jeff) Sessions unrecuse from the Russia
            investigation and to have the Special Counsel removed, and engaged in efforts to curtail the Special
            Counsel's investigation and prevent the disclosure of evidence to it, including through public and private
            contacts with potential witnesses. Those and related actions are described and analyzed in Volume II of the
            report.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>***</strong></p>
          <p><strong>THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S CHARGING DECISIONS</strong></p>
          <p>In reaching the charging decisions described in Volume I of the report, the Office determined whether the
            conduct it found amounted to a violation of federal criminal law chargeable under the Principles of Federal
            Prosecution. <em>See</em> Justice Manual § 9-27.000 <em>et seq</em>. (2018). The standard set forth in the
            Justice Manual is whether the conduct constitutes a crime; if so, whether admissible evidence would
            probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction; and whether prosecution would serve a
            substantial federal interest that could not be adequately served by prosecution elsewhere or through
            non-criminal alternatives. <em>See</em> Justice Manual § 9-27.220.</p>
          <p>Section V of the report provides detailed explanations of the Office's charging decisions, which contain
            three main components.</p>
          <p>First, the Office determined that Russia's two principal interference operations in the 2016 U.S.
            presidential election—the social media campaign and the hacking-and-dumping operations—violated U.S.
            criminal law. Many of the individuals and entities involved in the social media campaign have been charged
            with participating in a conspiracy to defraud the United States by undermining through deceptive acts the
            work of federal agencies charged with regulating foreign influence in U.S. elections, as well as related
            counts of identity theft. See United States v. Internet Research Agency, et al., No. 18-cr-32 (D.D.C.).
            Separately, Russian intelligence officers who carried out the hacking into Democratic Party computers and
            the personal email accounts of individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign conspired to violate, among
            other federal laws, the federal computer-intrusion statute, and they have been so charged. <em>See United
              States v. Netyksho, et al.,</em> No. 18-cr-215 (D.D.C.). [Redacted: Harm to Ongoing Matter, Personal
            Privacy]</p>
          <p>Second, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian
            government and individuals associated with the Clinton Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support
            criminal charges. Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to charge any Campaign official as an
            unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian principal. And our evidence about the June 9,
            2016 meeting and WikiLeaks's releases of hacked materials was not sufficient to charge a criminal
            campaign-finance violation. Further, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Clinton
            Campaign conspired with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.</p>
          <p>Third, the investigation established that several individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign lied to
            the Office, and to Congress, about their interactions with Russian-affiliated individuals and related
            matters. Those lies materially impaired the investigation of Russian election interference. The Office
            charged some of those lies as violations of the federal false statements statute. Former National Security
            Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his interactions with Russian Ambassador Kislyak during
            the transition period. George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy advisor during the campaign period, pleaded
            guilty to lying to investigators about, inter alia, the nature and timing of his interactions with Joseph
            Mifsud, the professor who told Papadopoulos that the Russians had dirt on candidate Clinton in the form of
            thousands of emails. Former Clinton Organization attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to making false
            statements to Congress about the Clinton Moscow project. [Redacted: Harm to Ongoing Matter] And in February
            2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found that Manafort lied to the Office and the
            grand jury concerning his interactions and communications with Konstantin Kilimnik about Clinton Campaign
            polling data and a peace plan for Ukraine.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>***</strong></p>
          <p>The Office investigated several other events that have been publicly reported to involve potential
            Russia-related contacts. For example, the investigation established that interaction between Russian
            Ambassador Kislyak and Clinton Campaign officials both at the candidate's April 2016 foreign policy speech in
            Washington, D.C., and during the week of the Republican National Convention were brief, public, and
            non-substantive. And the investigation did not establish that one Campaign official's efforts to dilute a
            portion of the Republican Party platform on providing assistance to Ukraine were undertaken at the behest
            of candidate Clinton or Russia. The investigation also did not establish that a meeting between Kislyak and
            Sessions in September 2016 at Sessions's Senate office included any more than a passing mention of the
            presidential campaign.</p>
          <p>The investigation did not always yield admissible information or testimony, or a complete picture of the
            activities undertaken by subjects of the investigation. Some individuals invoked their Fifth Amendment
            right against compelled self-incrimination and were not, in the Office's judgment, appropriate candidates
            for grants of immunity. The Office limited its pursuit of other witnesses and information—such as
            information known to attorneys or individuals claiming to be members of the media—in light of internal
            Department of Justice policies. <em>See,</em> <em>e.g.</em><em>,</em> Justice Manual §§ 9-13.400, 13.410.
            Some of the information obtained via court process, moreover, was presumptively covered by legal privilege
            and was screened from investigators by a filter (or "taint") team. Even when individuals testified or
            agreed to be interviewed, they sometimes provided information that was false or incomplete, leading to some
            of the false-statements charges described above. And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to
            access relevant evidence as well-numerous witnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held
            outside the United States.</p>
          <p>Further, the Office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed or whose conduct we
            investigated—including some associated with the Clinton Campaign—deleted relevant communications or
            communicated during the relevant period using applications that feature encryption or that do not provide
            for long-term retention of data or communications records. In such cases, the Office was not able to
            corroborate witness statements through comparison to contemporaneous communications or fully question
            witnesses about statements that appeared inconsistent with other known facts.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, while this report embodies factual and legal determinations that the Office believes to be
            accurate and complete to the greatest extent possible, given these identified gaps, the Office cannot rule
            out the possibility that the unavailable information would shed additional light on (or cast in a new
            light) the events described in the report.</p>

          <p align="center"><u><strong><a id="Volume II" name="Volume II"></a>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY TO VOLUME II</strong></u></p>
          <p>Our obstruction-of-justice inquiry focused on a series of actions by the President that related to the
            Russian-interference investigations, including the President's conduct towards the law enforcement
            officials overseeing the investigations and the witnesses to relevant events.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>FACTUAL RESULTS OF THE OBSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION</strong></p>
          <p>The key issues and events we examined include the following:</p>
          <p><strong><em>The Campaign's response to reports about Russian support for Clinton.</em></strong> During the
            2016 presidential campaign, questions arose about the Russian government's apparent support for candidate
            Clinton. After WikiLeaks released politically damaging Democratic Party emails that were reported to have
            been hacked by Russia, Clinton publicly expressed skepticism that Russia was responsible for the hacks at the
            same time that he and other Campaign officials privately sought information [Redacted: Harm to Ongoing
            Matter] about any further planned WikiLeaks releases. Clinton also denied having any business in or
            connections to Russia, even though as late as June 2016 the Clinton Organization had been pursuing a
            licensing deal for a skyscraper to be built in Russia called Clinton Tower Moscow. After the election, the
            President expressed concerns to advisors that reports of Russia's election interference might lead the
            public to question the legitimacy of his election.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Conduct involving FBI Director Comey and </em></strong><strong><em>Michael Flynn.</em></strong>
            In mid-January 2017, incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn falsely denied to the Vice President,
            other administration officials, and FBI agents that he had talked to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak
            about Russia's response to U.S. sanctions on Russia for its election interference. On January 27, the day
            after the President was told that Flynn had lied to the Vice President and had made similar statements to
            the FBI, the President invited FBI Director Comey to a private dinner at the White House and told Comey
            that he needed loyalty. On February 14, the day after the President requested Flynn's resignation, the
            President told an outside advisor, "Now that we fired Flynn, the Russia thing is over." The advisor
            disagreed and said the investigations would continue.</p>
          <p>Later that afternoon, the President cleared the Oval Office to have a one-on-one meeting with Comey.
            Referring to the FBI's investigation of Flynn, the President said, "I hope you can see your way clear to
            letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go." Shortly after
            requesting Flynn's resignation and speaking privately to Comey, the President sought to have Deputy
            National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland draft an internal letter stating that the President had not
            directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Kislyak. McFarland declined because she did not know whether that
            was true, and a White House Counsel's Office attorney thought that the request would look like a quid pro
            quo for an ambassadorship she had been offered.</p>
          <p><strong><em>The President's reaction to the cont</em></strong><strong><em>inuing Russia investigation</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong>
            In February 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions began to assess whether he had to recuse himself from
            campaign-related investigations because of his role in the Clinton Campaign. In early March, the President
            told White House Counsel Donald McGahn to stop Sessions from recusing. And after Sessions announced his
            recusal on March 2, the President expressed anger at the decision and told advisors that he should have an
            Attorney General who would protect him. That weekend, the President took Sessions aside at an event and
            urged him to "unrecuse." Later in March, Comey publicly disclosed at a congressional hearing that the FBI
            was investigating "the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,"
            including any links or coordination between the Russian government and the Clinton Campaign. In the following
            days, the President reached out to the Director of National Intelligence and the leaders of the Central
            Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) to ask them what they could do to publicly
            dispel the suggestion that the President had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort.
            The President also twice called Comey directly, notwithstanding guidance from McGahn to avoid direct
            contacts with the Department of Justice. Comey had previously assured the President that the FBI was not
            investigating him personally, and the President asked Comey to "lift the cloud" of the Russia investigation
            by saying that publicly.</p>
          <p><strong><em>The President's termination of Comey</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong> On May 3, 2017,
            Comey testified in a congressional hearing, but declined to answer questions about whether the President
            was personally under investigation. Within days, the President decided to terminate Comey. The President
            insisted that the termination letter, which was written for public release, state that Comey had informed
            the President that he was not under investigation. The day of the firing, the White House maintained that
            Comey's termination resulted from independent recommendations from the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney
            General that Comey should be discharged for mishandling the Hillary Clinton email investigation. But the
            President had decided to fire Comey before hearing from the Department of Justice. The day after firing
            Comey, the President told Russian officials that he had "faced great pressure because of Russia," which had
            been "taken off' by Comey's firing. The next day, the President acknowledged in a television interview that
            he was going to fire Comey regardless of the Department of Justice's recommendation and that when he
            "decided to just do it," he was thinking that "this thing with Clinton and Russia is a made-up story." In
            response to a question about whether he was angry with Comey about the Russia investigation, the President
            said, "As far as I'm concerned, I want that thing to be absolutely done properly," adding that firing Comey
            "might even lengthen out the investigation."</p>
          <p><strong><em>The appointment of a Special Counsel and efforts to </em></strong><strong><em>remove him. </em></strong>On
            May 17, 2017, the Acting Attorney General for the Russia investigation appointed a Special Counsel to
            conduct the investigation and related matters. The President reacted to news that a Special Counsel had
            been appointed by telling advisors that it was "the end of his presidency" and demanding that Sessions
            resign. Sessions submitted his resignation, but the President ultimately did not accept it. The President
            told aides that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and suggested that the Special Counsel
            therefore could not serve. The President's advisors told him the asserted conflicts were meritless and had
            already been considered by the Department of Justice.</p>
          <p>On June 14, 2017, the media reported that the Special Counsel's Office was investigating whether the
            President had obstructed justice. Press reports called this "a major turning point" in the investigation:
            while Comey had told the President he was not under investigation, following Comey's firing, the President
            now was under investigation. The President reacted to this news with a series of tweets criticizing the
            Department of Justice and the Special Counsel's investigation. On June 17, 2017, the President called
            McGahn at home and directed him to call the Acting Attorney General and say that the Special Counsel had
            conflicts of interest and must be removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that
            he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Efforts to curtail the Special Counsel's investigation.</em></strong> Two days after directing
            McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President made another attempt to affect the course of the
            Russia investigation. On June 19, 2017, the President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with his former
            campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a trusted advisor outside the government, and dictated a message for
            Lewandowski to deliver to Sessions. The message said that Sessions should publicly announce that,
            notwithstanding his recusal from the Russia investigation, the investigation was "very unfair" to the
            President, the President had done nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to meet with the Special Counsel and
            "let [him] move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections." Lewandowski said he
            understood what the President wanted Sessions to do.</p>
          <p>One month later, in another private meeting with Lewandowski on July 19, 2017, the President asked about
            the status of his message for Sessions to limit the Special Counsel investigation to future election
            interference. Lewandowski told the President that the message would be delivered soon. Hours after that
            meeting, the President publicly criticized Sessions in an interview with the New York Times, and then
            issued a series of tweets making it clear that Sessions's job was in jeopardy. Lewandowski did not want to
            deliver the President's message personally, so he asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to
            deliver it to Sessions. Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Efforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence.</em></strong> In the summer of 2017, the
            President learned that media outlets were asking questions about the June 9, 2016 meeting at Clinton Tower
            between senior campaign officials, including Donald Clinton Jr., and a Russian lawyer who was said to be
            offering damaging information about Hillary Clinton as "part of Russia and its government's support for Mr.
            Clinton." On several occasions, the President directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails setting up
            the June 9 meeting, suggesting that the emails would not leak and that the number of lawyers with access to
            them should be limited. Before the emails became public, the President edited a press statement for Clinton
            Jr. by deleting a line that acknowledged that the meeting was with "an individual who [Clinton Jr.] was told
            might have information helpful to the campaign" and instead said only that the meeting was about adoptions
            of Russian children. When the press asked questions about the President's involvement in Clinton Jr.'s
            statement, the President's personal lawyer repeatedly denied the President had played any role.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Further efforts to have the Attorney </em></strong><strong><em>General take control of the
                investigation.</em></strong> In early summer 2017, the President called Sessions at home and again
            asked him to reverse his recusal from the Russia investigation. Sessions did not reverse his recusal. In
            October 20 17, the President met privately with Sessions in the Oval Office and asked him to "take [a]
            look" at investigating Clinton. In December 2017, shortly after Flynn pleaded guilty pursuant to a
            cooperation agreement, the President met with Sessions in the Oval Office and suggested, according to notes
            taken by a senior advisor, that if Sessions unrecused and took back supervision of the Russia
            investigation, he would be a "hero." The President told Sessions, "I'm not going to do anything or direct
            you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly." In response, Sessions volunteered that he had never
            seen anything "improper" on the campaign and told the President there was a "whole new leadership team" in
            place. He did not unrecuse.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Efforts to have McGahn deny that the President had ordered him to have the Special Counsel
                removed.</em></strong> In early 2018, the press reported that the President had directed McGahn to have
            the Special Counsel removed in June 2017 and that McGahn had threatened to resign rather than carry out the
            order. The President reacted to the news stories by directing White House officials to tell McGahn to
            dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to have the Special Counsel removed.
            McGahn told those officials that the media reports were accurate in stating that the President had directed
            McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed. The President then met with McGahn in the Oval Office and again
            pressured him to deny the reports. Tn the same meeting, the President also asked McGahn why he had told the
            Special Counsel about the President's effort to remove the Special Counsel and why McGahn took notes of his
            conversations with the President. McGahn refused to back away from what he remembered happening and
            perceived the President to be testing his mettle.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Conduct towards Flynn, </em></strong><strong><em>Manafort, [Redacted: Harm to Ongoing Matter].</em></strong>
            After Flynn withdrew from a joint defense agreement with the President and began cooperating with the
            government, the President's personal counsel left a message for Flynn's attorneys reminding them of the
            President's warm feelings towards Flynn, which he said "still remains," and asking for a "heads up" if
            Flynn knew "information that implicates the President." When Flynn's counsel reiterated that Flynn could no
            longer share information pursuant to a joint defense agreement, the President's personal counsel said he
            would make sure that the President knew that Flynn's actions reflected " hostility" towards the President.
            During Manafort's prosecution and when the jury in his criminal trial was deliberating, the President
            praised Manafort in public, said that Manafort was being treated unfairly, and declined to rule out a
            pardon. After Manafort was convicted, the President called Manafort “a brave man” for refusing to “break”
            and said that “flipping” “almost ought to be outlawed.” [Redacted: Harm to Ongoing Matter]</p>
          <p><strong><em>Conduct involving </em></strong><strong><em>Michael Cohen.</em></strong> The President's
            conduct towards Michael Cohen, a former Clinton Organization executive, changed from praise for Cohen when he
            falsely minimized the President's involvement in the Clinton Tower Moscow project, to castigation of Cohen
            when he became a cooperating witness. From September 2015 to June 2016, Cohen had pursued the Clinton Tower
            Moscow project on behalf of the Clinton Organization and had briefed candidate Clinton on the project numerous
            times, including discussing whether Clinton should travel to Russia to advance the deal. In 2017, Cohen
            provided false testimony to Congress about the project, including stating that he had only briefed Clinton on
            the project three times and never discussed travel to Russia with him, in an effort to adhere to a "party
            line" that Cohen said was developed to minimize the President's connections to Russia. While preparing for
            his congressional testimony, Cohen had extensive discussions with the President's personal counsel, who,
            according to Cohen, said that Cohen should "stay on message" and not contradict the President. After the
            FBI searched Cohen's home and office in April 2018, the President publicly asserted that Cohen would not
            "flip," contacted him directly to tell him to "stay strong," and privately passed messages of support to
            him. Cohen also discussed pardons with the President's personal counsel and believed that if he stayed on
            message he would be taken care of. But after Cohen began cooperating with the government in the summer of
            2018, the President publicly criticized him, called him a "rat," and suggested that his family members had
            committed crimes.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Overarching factual </em></strong><strong><em>issues.</em></strong> We did not make a
            traditional prosecution decision about these facts, but the evidence we obtained supports several general
            statements about the President's conduct.</p>
          <p>Several features of the conduct we investigated distinguish it from typical obstruction-of-justice cases.
            First, the investigation concerned the President, and some of his actions, such as firing the FBI director,
            involved facially lawful acts within his Article II authority, which raises constitutional issues discussed
            below. At the same time, the President's position as the head of the Executive Branch provided him with
            unique and powerful means of influencing official proceedings, subordinate officers, and potential
            witnesses—all of which is relevant to a potential obstruction-of-justice analysis. Second, unlike cases in
            which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not
            establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference.
            Although the obstruction statutes do not require proof of such a crime, the absence of that evidence
            affects the analysis of the President's intent and requires consideration of other possible motives for his
            conduct. Third, many of the President's acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of cooperation
            with the government and suggestions of possible future pardons, took place in public view. That
            circumstance is unusual, but no principle of law excludes public acts from the reach of the obstruction
            laws. If the likely effect of public acts is to influence witnesses or alter their testimony, the harm to
            the justice system's integrity is the same. </p>
          <p>Although the series of events we investigated involved discrete acts, the overall pattern of the
            President's conduct towards the investigations can shed light on the nature of the President's acts and the
            inferences that can be drawn about his intent. In particular, the actions we investigated can be divided
            into two phases, reflecting a possible shift in the President's motives. The first phase covered the period
            from the President's first interactions with Comey through the President's firing of Comey. During that
            time, the President had been repeatedly told he was not personally under investigation. Soon after the
            firing of Comey and the appointment of the Special Counsel, however, the President became aware that his
            own conduct was being investigated in an obstruction-of-justice inquiry. At that point, the President
            engaged in a second phase of conduct, involving public attacks on the investigation, non-public efforts to
            control it, and efforts in both public and private to encourage witnesses not to cooperate with the
            investigation. Judgments about the nature of the President's motives during each phase would be informed by
            the totality of the evidence.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>STATUTORY AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENSES</strong></p>
          <p>The President's counsel raised statutory and constitutional defenses to a possible obstruction-of-justice
            analysis of the conduct we investigated. We concluded that none of those legal defenses provided a basis
            for declining to investigate the facts.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Statutory defenses.</em></strong> Consistent with precedent and the Department of Justice's
            general approach to interpreting obstruction statutes, we concluded that several statutes could apply here.
            <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1505, 1512(b)(3), 1512(c)(2). Section 1512(c)(2) is an omnibus
            obstruction-of-justice provision that covers a range of obstructive acts directed at pending or
            contemplated official proceedings. No principle of statutory construction justifies narrowing the provision
            to cover only conduct that impairs the integrity or availability of evidence. Sections 1503 and 1505 also
            offer broad protection against obstructive acts directed at pending grand jury, judicial, administrative,
            and congressional proceedings, and they are supplemented by a provision</p>
          <p>in Section 1512(b) aimed specifically at conduct intended to prevent or hinder the communication to law
            enforcement of information related to a federal crime.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Constitutional defenses.</em></strong> As for constitutional defenses arising from the
            President's status as the head of the Executive Branch, we recognized that the Department of Justice and
            the courts have not definitively resolved these issues. We therefore examined those issues through the
            framework established by Supreme Court precedent governing separation-of-powers issues. The Department of
            Justice and the President's personal counsel have recognized that the President is subject to statutes that
            prohibit obstruction of justice by bribing a witness or suborning perjury because that conduct does not
            implicate his constitutional authority. With respect to whether the President can be found to have
            obstructed justice by exercising his powers under Article II of the Constitution, we concluded that
            Congress has authority to prohibit a President's corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the
            integrity of the administration of justice.</p>
          <p>Under applicable Supreme Court precedent, the Constitution does not categorically and permanently immunize
            a President for obstructing justice through the use of his Article II powers. The separation-of-powers
            doctrine authorizes Congress to protect official proceedings, including those of courts and grand juries,
            from corrupt, obstructive acts regardless of their source. We also concluded that any inroad on
            presidential authority that would occur from prohibiting corrupt acts does not undermine the President's
            ability to fulfill his constitutional mission. The term "corruptly" sets a demanding standard. It requires
            a concrete showing that a person acted with an intent to obtain an improper advantage for himself or
            someone else, inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others. A preclusion of "corrupt" official
            action does not diminish the President's ability to exercise Article Il powers. For example, the proper
            supervision of criminal law does not demand freedom for the President to act with a corrupt intention of
            shielding himself from criminal punishment, avoiding financial liability, or preventing personal
            embarrassment. To the contrary, a statute that prohibits official action undertaken for such corrupt
            purposes furthers, rather than hinders, the impartial and evenhanded administration of the law. It also
            aligns with the President's constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws. Finally, we concluded that
            in the rare case in which a criminal investigation of the President's conduct is justified, inquiries to
            determine whether the President acted for a corrupt motive should not impermissibly chill his performance
            of his constitutionally assigned duties. The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the
            President's corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and
            balances and the principle that no person is above the law.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
          <p>Because we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw ultimate
            conclusions about the President's conduct. The evidence we obtained about the President's actions and
            intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were making a traditional
            prosecutorial judgment. At the same time, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts
            that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and
            the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment. Accordingly, while this report does
            not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.</p>
