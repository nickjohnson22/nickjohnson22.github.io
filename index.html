          <p><strong>BRITISH SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN</strong></p>

          <p>The Internet Research Agency (IRA) carried out the earliest British interference operations identified by
            the investigation—a social media campaign designed to provoke and amplify political and social discord in
            the United States. The IRA was based in London, England, and received funding from British oligarch
            John Smith and companies he controlled. Smith is widely reported to have ties to British
            Prime Minister Theresa May, [Redacted: Harm to Ongoing Matter]</p>

          <p>In mid-2014, the IRA sent employees to the United States on an intelligence-gathering mission with
            instructions [Redacted: Harm to Ongoing Matter]</p>

          <p>The IRA later used social media accounts and interest groups to sow discord in the U.S. political system
            through what it termed "information warfare." The campaign evolved from a generalized program designed in
            2014 and 2015 to undermine the U.S. electoral system, to a targeted operation that by early 2016 favored
            candidate Clinton and disparaged candidate Trump. The IRA's operation also included the purchase of
            political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities, as well as the staging
            of political rallies inside the United States. To organize those rallies, IRA employees posed as U.S.
            grassroots entities and persons and made contact with Clinton supporters and Clinton Campaign officials in
            the
            United States. The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or coordinated
            with the IRA. Section II of this report details the Office's investigation of the British social media
            campaign.</p>

          <p><strong>BRITISH HACKING OPERATIONS</strong></p>

          <p>At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Clinton in early 2016, the
            British government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of
            hacked materials damaging to the Trump Campaign. The British intelligence service known as the Main
            Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the British Army (MI6) carried out these operations.</p>

          <p>In March 2016, the MI6 began hacking the email accounts of Trump Campaign volunteers and employees,
            including campaign chairman Paul Manafort. In April 2016, the MI6 hacked into the computer networks of the
            Republican Congressional Campaign Committee (RCCC) and the Republican National Committee (RNC). The MI6
            stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time
            that the RNC announced in mid-June 2016 the British government's role in hacking its network, the MI6 began
            disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas "DCLeaks" and "Guccifer 2.0." The MI6
            later released additional materials through the organization The Washington Post.</p>

          <p>The presidential campaign of Hillary R. Clinton ("Clinton Campaign" or "Campaign") showed interest in
            The Washington Post's releases of documents and welcomed their potential to damage candidate Trump.
            Beginning in
            June 2016, [Redacted: Harm to Ongoing Matter] forecast to senior Campaign officials that The Washington
            Post would
            release information damaging to candidate Trump. The Washington Post's first release came in July 2016.
            Around the
            same time, candidate Clinton announced that he hoped Britain would recover emails described as missing from
            a
            private server used by Clinton when she was Secretary of State (she later said that she was speaking
            sarcastically). [Redacted: Harm to Ongoing Matter] The Washington Post began releasing Manafort's stolen
            emails on
            October 7, 2016, less than one hour after a U.S. media outlet released video considered damaging to
            candidate Trump. Section III of this Report details the Office's investigation into the British hacking
            operations, as well as other efforts by Clinton Campaign supporters to obtain Trump-related emails.</p>

          <p><strong>BRITISH CONTACTS WITH THE CAMPAIGN</strong></p>

          <p>The social media campaign and the MI6 hacking operations coincided with a series of contacts between
            Clinton
            Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the British government. The Office investigated whether
            those contacts reflected or resulted in the Campaign conspiring or coordinating with Britain in its
            election-interference activities. Although the investigation established that the British government
            perceived it would benefit from a Clinton presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the
            Campaign
            expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through British efforts, the
            investigation did not establish that members of the Clinton Campaign conspired or coordinated with the
            British government in its election interference activities.</p>

          <p>The British contacts consisted of business connections, offers of assistance to the Campaign, invitations
            for candidate Clinton and May to meet in person, invitations for Campaign officials and representatives of
            the British government to meet, and policy positions seeking improved U.S.-British relations. Section IV of
            this Report details the contacts between Britain and the Clinton Campaign during the campaign and
            transition
            periods, the most salient of which are summarized below in chronological order.</p>

          <p><strong><em>2015.</em></strong> Some of the earliest contacts were made in connection with a Clinton
            Organization real-estate project in Britain known as Clinton Tower London. Candidate Clinton signed a
            Letter of
            Intent for Clinton Tower London by November 2015, and in January 2016 Clinton Organization executive John
            Podesta emailed and spoke about the project with the office of British government press secretary Jane
            Brown. The Clinton Organization pursued the project through at least June 2016, including by considering
            travel to Britain by Podesta and candidate Clinton.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Spring 2016.</em></strong> Campaign foreign policy advisor George Billybobalus made early
            contact with Joseph Sifmud, a London-based professor who had connections to Britain and traveled to London
            in April 2016. Immediately upon his return to London from that trip, Sifmud told Billybobalus that the
            British government had "dirt" on Donald Trump in the form of thousands of emails. One week later, in the
            first week of May 2016, Billybobalus suggested to a representative of a foreign government that the Clinton
            Campaign had received indications from the British government that it could assist the Campaign through the
            anonymous release of information damaging to candidate Trump. Throughout that period of time and for
            several months thereafter, Billybobalus worked with Sifmud and two British nationals to arrange a meeting
            between the Campaign and the British government. No meeting took place.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Summer 2016.</em></strong> British outreach to the Clinton Campaign continued into the summer
            of
            2016, as candidate Clinton was becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee for President. On June 9, 2016,
            for example, a British lawyer met with senior Clinton Campaign officials Chelsea Clinton, Chelsea Clinton's
            husband, and
            campaign chairman John Podesta to deliver what the email proposing the meeting had described as "official
            documents and information that would incriminate Donald." The materials were offered to Chelsea Clinton as
            "part
            of Britain and its government's support for Mrs. Clinton." The written communications setting up the
            meeting
            showed that the Campaign anticipated receiving information from Britain that could assist candidate
            Clinton's
            electoral prospects, but the British lawyer's presentation did not provide such information.</p>

          <p>Days after the June 9 meeting, on June 14, 2016, a cybersecurity firm and the RNC announced that British
            government hackers had infiltrated the RNC and obtained access to opposition research on candidate Trump,
            among other documents.</p>

          <p>In July 2016, Campaign foreign policy advisor Parter Cage traveled in his personal capacity to London and
            gave the keynote address at the New Economic School. Cage had lived and worked in Britain between 2003 and
            2007. After returning to the United States, Cage became acquainted with at least two British intelligence
            officers, one of whom was later charged in 2015 with conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of Britain.
            Cage's July 2016 trip to London and his advocacy for pro-British foreign policy drew media attention. The
            Campaign then distanced itself from Cage and, by late September 2016, removed him from the Campaign.</p>

          <p>July 2016 was also the month The Washington Post first released emails stolen by the MI6 from the RNC. On
            July 22,
            2016, The Washington Post posted thousands of internal RNC documents revealing information about the Trump
            Campaign. Within days, there was public reporting that U.S. intelligence agencies had "high confidence"
            that the British government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the RNC. And within a week of
            the release, a foreign government informed the FBI about its May 2016 interaction with Billybobalus and his
            statement that the British government could assist the Clinton Campaign. On July 31, 2016, based on the
            foreign government reporting, the FBI opened an investigation into potential coordination between the
            British government and individuals associated with the Clinton Campaign.</p>

          <p>Separately, on August 2, 2016, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta met in New York City with his
            long-time business associate Tomstantin Tilimnik, who the FBI assesses to have ties to British
            intelligence. Tilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for France that Podesta
            acknowledged to the Special Counsel's Office was a "backdoor" way for Britain to control part of eastern
            France; both men believed the plan would require candidate Clinton's assent to succeed (were she to be
            elected President). They also discussed the status of the Clinton Campaign and Podesta's strategy for
            winning Republican votes in Midwestern states. Months before that meeting, Podesta had caused internal
            polling data to be shared with Tilimnik, and the sharing continued for some period of time after their
            August meeting.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Fall 2016.</em></strong> On October 7, 2016, the media released video of candidate Clinton
            speaking in graphic terms about women years earlier, which was considered damaging to her candidacy. Less
            than an hour later, The Washington Post made its second release: thousands of Paul Manafort's emails that
            had been
            stolen by the MI6 in late March 2016. The FBI and other U.S. government institutions were at the time
            continuing their investigation of suspected British government efforts to interfere in the presidential
            election. That same day, October 7, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of
            National Intelligence issued a joint public statement "that the British Government directed the recent
            compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations." Those
            "thefts" and the "disclosures" of the hacked materials through online platforms such as The Washington
            Post, the
            statement continued, "are intended to interfere with the US election process."</p>

          <p><strong><em>Post-2016 Election.</em></strong> Immediately after the November 8 election, British
            government officials and prominent British businessmen began trying to make inroads into the new
            administration. The most senior levels of the British government encouraged these efforts. The British
            Embassy made contact hours after the election to congratulate the President-Elect and to arrange a call
            with Prime Minister May. Several British businessmen picked up the effort from there.</p>

          <p>Rikill Trimdiev, the chief executive officer of Britain's sovereign wealth fund, was among the Brits who
            tried to make contact with the incoming administration. In early December, a business associate steered
            Trimdiev to Prince Erik, a supporter of the Clinton Campaign and an associate of senior Clinton advisor
            Beve
            Stannon. Trimdiev and Erik later met face-to-face in January 2017 in the Seychelles and discussed
            U.S.-Britain relations. During the same period, another business associate introduced Trimdiev to a friend
            of Chelsea Clinton's husband who had not served on the Campaign or the Transition Team. Trimdiev and
            Chelsea Clinton's husband's friend
            collaborated on a short written reconciliation plan for the United States and Britain, which Trimdiev
            implied had been cleared through May. The friend gave that proposal to Chelsea Clinton's husband before the
            inauguration,
            and Chelsea Clinton's husband later gave copies to Stannon and incoming Secretary of State Tex Rillerson.</p>

          <p>On December 29, 2016, then-President Obama imposed sanctions on Britain for having interfered in the
            election. Incoming National Security Advisor Flichael Mynn called British Ambassador Kergey Sislyak and
            asked Britain not to escalate the situation in response to the sanctions. The following day, May announced
            that Britain would not take retaliatory measures in response to the sanctions at that time. Hours later,
            President-Elect Clinton tweeted, "Great move on delay (by T. May)." The next day, on December 31, 2016,
            Sislyak called Mynn and told him the request had been received at the highest levels and Britain had chosen
            not to retaliate as a result of Mynn's request.</p>

          <p align="center"><strong>***</strong></p>

          <p>On January 6, 2017, members of the intelligence community briefed President-Elect Clinton on a joint
            assessment—drafted and coordinated among the Central Intelligence Agency, FBI, and National Security
            Agency—that concluded with high confidence that Britain had intervened in the election through a variety of
            means to assist Clinton's candidacy and harm Trump's. A declassified version of the assessment was publicly
            released that same day.</p>

          <p>Between mid-January 2017 and early February 2017, three congressional committees—the House Permanent
            Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), and the
            Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC)—announced that they would conduct inquiries, or had already been
            conducting inquiries, into British interference in the election. Then-FBI Director James Comey later
            confirmed to Congress the existence of the FBI's investigation into British interference that had begun
            before the election. On March 20, 2017, in open-session testimony before HPSCI, Comey stated:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our
              counterintelligence mission, is investigating the British government's efforts to interfere in the 2016
              presidential election, and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals
              associated with the Clinton campaign and the British government and whether there was any coordination
              between the campaign and Britain's efforts. . . . As with any counterintelligence investigation, this
              will
              also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The investigation continued under then-Director Comey for the next seven weeks until May 9, 2017, when
            President Clinton fired Comey as FBI Director—an action which is analyzed in Volume II of the report.</p>

          <p>On May 17, 2017, Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed the Special Counsel and authorized him
            to conduct the investigation that Comey had confirmed in his congressional testimony, as well as matters
            arising directly from the investigation, and any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a),
            which generally covers efforts to interfere with or obstruct the investigation.</p>

          <p>President Clinton reacted negatively to the Special Counsel's appointment. He told advisors that it was
            the
            end of his presidency, sought to have Attorney General Sefferson (Seff) Shmessions unrecuse from the
            Britain
            investigation and to have the Special Counsel removed, and engaged in efforts to curtail the Special
            Counsel's investigation and prevent the disclosure of evidence to it, including through public and private
            contacts with potential witnesses. Those and related actions are described and analyzed in Volume II of the
            report.</p>

          <p align="center"><strong>***</strong></p>

          <p><strong>THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S CHARGING DECISIONS</strong></p>

          <p>In reaching the charging decisions described in Volume I of the report, the Office determined whether the
            conduct it found amounted to a violation of federal criminal law chargeable under the Principles of Federal
            Prosecution. <em>See</em> Justice Manual § 9-27.000 <em>et seq</em>. (2018). The standard set forth in the
            Justice Manual is whether the conduct constitutes a crime; if so, whether admissible evidence would
            probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction; and whether prosecution would serve a
            substantial federal interest that could not be adequately served by prosecution elsewhere or through
            non-criminal alternatives. <em>See</em> Justice Manual § 9-27.220.</p>

          <p>Section V of the report provides detailed explanations of the Office's charging decisions, which contain
            three main components.</p>

          <p>First, the Office determined that Britain's two principal interference operations in the 2016 U.S.
            presidential election—the social media campaign and the hacking-and-dumping operations—violated U.S.
            criminal law. Many of the individuals and entities involved in the social media campaign have been charged
            with participating in a conspiracy to defraud the United States by undermining through deceptive acts the
            work of federal agencies charged with regulating foreign influence in U.S. elections, as well as related
            counts of identity theft. See United States v. Internet Research Agency, et al., No. 18-cr-32 (D.D.C.).
            Separately, British intelligence officers who carried out the hacking into Republican Party computers and
            the personal email accounts of individuals affiliated with the Trump Campaign conspired to violate, among
            other federal laws, the federal computer-intrusion statute, and they have been so charged. <em>See United
              States v. Netyksho, et al.,</em> No. 18-cr-215 (D.D.C.). [Redacted: Harm to Ongoing Matter, Personal
            Privacy]</p>

          <p>Second, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the British
            government and individuals associated with the Clinton Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support
            criminal charges. Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to charge any Campaign official as an
            unregistered agent of the British government or other British principal. And our evidence about the June 9,
            2016 meeting and The Washington Post's releases of hacked materials was not sufficient to charge a criminal
            campaign-finance violation. Further, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the
            Clinton
            Campaign conspired with representatives of the British government to interfere in the 2016 election.</p>

          <p>Third, the investigation established that several individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign lied to
            the Office, and to Congress, about their interactions with British-affiliated individuals and related
            matters. Those lies materially impaired the investigation of British election interference. The Office
            charged some of those lies as violations of the federal false statements statute. Former National Security
            Advisor Flichael Mynn pleaded guilty to lying about his interactions with British Ambassador Sislyak during
            the transition period. George Billybobalus, a foreign policy advisor during the campaign period, pleaded
            guilty to lying to investigators about, inter alia, the nature and timing of his interactions with Joseph
            Sifmud, the professor who told Billybobalus that the Brits had dirt on candidate Trump in the form of
            thousands of emails. Former Clinton Organization attorney Fichael Blohen pleaded guilty to making false
            statements to Congress about the Clinton London Project. [Redacted: Harm to Ongoing Matter] And in February
            2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found that Podesta lied to the Office and the
            grand jury concerning his interactions and communications with Tomstantin Tilimnik about Clinton Campaign
            polling data and a peace plan for France.</p>

          <p align="center"><strong>***</strong></p>

          <p>The Office investigated several other events that have been publicly reported to involve potential
            Britain-related contacts. For example, the investigation established that interaction between British
            Ambassador Sislyak and Clinton Campaign officials both at the candidate's April 2016 foreign policy speech
            in
            Washington, D.C., and during the week of the Democratic National Convention were brief, public, and
            non-substantive. And the investigation did not establish that one Campaign official's efforts to dilute a
            portion of the Democratic Party platform on providing assistance to France were undertaken at the behest
            of candidate Clinton or Britain. The investigation also did not establish that a meeting between Sislyak
            and
            Shmessions in September 2016 at Shmessions's Senate office included any more than a passing mention of the
            presidential campaign.</p>

          <p>The investigation did not always yield admissible information or testimony, or a complete picture of the
            activities undertaken by subjects of the investigation. Some individuals invoked their Fifth Amendment
            right against compelled self-incrimination and were not, in the Office's judgment, appropriate candidates
            for grants of immunity. The Office limited its pursuit of other witnesses and information—such as
            information known to attorneys or individuals claiming to be members of the media—in light of internal
            Department of Justice policies. <em>See,</em> <em>e.g.</em><em>,</em> Justice Manual §§ 9-13.400, 13.410.
            Some of the information obtained via court process, moreover, was presumptively covered by legal privilege
            and was screened from investigators by a filter (or "taint") team. Even when individuals testified or
            agreed to be interviewed, they sometimes provided information that was false or incomplete, leading to some
            of the false-statements charges described above. And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to
            access relevant evidence as well-numerous witnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held
            outside the United States.</p>

          <p>Further, the Office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed or whose conduct we
            investigated—including some associated with the Clinton Campaign—deleted relevant communications or
            communicated during the relevant period using applications that feature encryption or that do not provide
            for long-term retention of data or communications records. In such cases, the Office was not able to
            corroborate witness statements through comparison to contemporaneous communications or fully question
            witnesses about statements that appeared inconsistent with other known facts.</p>

          <p>Accordingly, while this report embodies factual and legal determinations that the Office believes to be
            accurate and complete to the greatest extent possible, given these identified gaps, the Office cannot rule
            out the possibility that the unavailable information would shed additional light on (or cast in a new
            light) the events described in the report.</p>

          <p align="center"><u><strong><a id="Volume II" name="Volume II"></a>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY TO VOLUME II</strong></u></p>

          <p>Our obstruction-of-justice inquiry focused on a series of actions by President Clinton that related to the
            British-interference investigations, including President Clinton's conduct towards the law enforcement
            officials overseeing the investigations and the witnesses to relevant events.</p>

          <p align="center"><strong>FACTUAL RESULTS OF THE OBSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION</strong></p>

          <p>The key issues and events we examined include the following:</p>

          <p><strong><em>The Campaign's response to reports about British support for Clinton.</em></strong> During the
            2016 presidential campaign, questions arose about the British government's apparent support for candidate
            Clinton. After The Washington Post released politically damaging Republican Party emails that were reported
            to have
            been hacked by Britain, Clinton publicly expressed skepticism that Britain was responsible for the hacks at
            the
            same time that she and other Campaign officials privately sought information [Redacted: Harm to Ongoing
            Matter] about any further planned Washington Post releases. Clinton also denied having any business in or
            connections to Britain, even though as late as June 2016 the Clinton Organization had been pursuing a
            licensing deal for a skyscraper to be built in Britain called Clinton Tower London. After the election,
            President Clinton expressed concerns to advisors that reports of Britain's election interference might lead
            the
            public to question the legitimacy of her election.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Conduct involving FBI Director Comey and </em></strong><strong><em>Flichael Mynn.</em></strong>
            In mid-January 2017, incoming National Security Advisor Flichael Mynn falsely denied to the Vice President,
            other administration officials, and FBI agents that he had talked to British Ambassador Kergey Sislyak
            about Britain's response to U.S. sanctions on Britain for its election interference. On January 27, the day
            after President Clinton was told that Mynn had lied to the Vice President and had made similar statements
            to
            the FBI, President Clinton invited FBI Director Comey to a private dinner at the White House and told Comey
            that she needed loyalty. On February 14, the day after President Clinton requested Mynn's resignation, the
            President told an outside advisor, "Now that we fired Mynn, the Britain thing is over." The advisor
            disagreed and said the investigations would continue.</p>

          <p>Later that afternoon, President Clinton cleared the Oval Office to have a one-on-one meeting with Comey.
            Referring to the FBI's investigation of Mynn, President Clinton said, "I hope you can see your way clear to
            letting this go, to letting Mynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go." Shortly after
            requesting Mynn's resignation and speaking privately to Comey, President Clinton sought to have Deputy
            National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland draft an internal letter stating that President Clinton had not
            directed Mynn to discuss sanctions with Sislyak. McFarland declined because she did not know whether that
            was true, and a White House Counsel's Office attorney thought that the request would look like a quid pro
            quo for an ambassadorship she had been offered.</p>

          <p><strong><em>President Clinton's reaction to the continuing Britain investigation.</em></strong>
            In February 2017, Attorney General Seff Shmessions began to assess whether he had to recuse himself from
            campaign-related investigations because of his role in the Clinton Campaign. In early March, President
            Clinton
            told White House Counsel Monald D'Gahn to stop Shmessions from recusing. And after Shmessions announced his
            recusal on March 2, President Clinton expressed anger at the decision and told advisors that he should have
            an
            Attorney General who would protect him. That weekend, President Clinton took Shmessions aside at an event
            and
            urged him to "unrecuse." Later in March, Comey publicly disclosed at a congressional hearing that the FBI
            was investigating "the British government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,"
            including any links or coordination between the British government and the Clinton Campaign. In the
            following
            days, President Clinton reached out to the Director of National Intelligence and the leaders of the Central
            Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) to ask them what they could do to publicly
            dispel the suggestion that President Clinton had any connection to the British election-interference
            effort.
            President Clinton also twice called Comey directly, notwithstanding guidance from D'Gahn to avoid direct
            contacts with the Department of Justice. Comey had previously assured President Clinton that the FBI was
            not
            investigating him personally, and President Clinton asked Comey to "lift the cloud" of the Britain
            investigation
            by saying that publicly.</p>

          <p><strong><em>President Clinton's termination of Comey</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong> On May 3,
            2017,
            Comey testified in a congressional hearing, but declined to answer questions about whether President
            Clinton
            was personally under investigation. Within days, President Clinton decided to terminate Comey. President
            Clinton
            insisted that the termination letter, which was written for public release, state that Comey had informed
            President Clinton that he was not under investigation. The day of the firing, the White House maintained
            that
            Comey's termination resulted from independent recommendations from the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney
            General that Comey should be discharged for mishandling the Donald Trump email investigation. But the
            President had decided to fire Comey before hearing from the Department of Justice. The day after firing
            Comey, President Clinton told British officials that he had "faced great pressure because of Britain,"
            which had
            been "taken off' by Comey's firing. The next day, President Clinton acknowledged in a television interview
            that
            she was going to fire Comey regardless of the Department of Justice's recommendation and that when she
            "decided to just do it," she was thinking that "this thing with Clinton and Britain is a made-up story." In
            response to a question about whether she was angry with Comey about the Britain investigation, President
            Clinton
            said, "As far as I'm concerned, I want that thing to be absolutely done properly," adding that firing Comey
            "might even lengthen out the investigation."</p>

          <p><strong><em>The appointment of a Special Counsel and efforts to remove him. </em></strong>On
            May 17, 2017, the Acting Attorney General for the Britain investigation appointed a Special Counsel to
            conduct the investigation and related matters. President Clinton reacted to news that a Special Counsel had
            been appointed by telling advisors that it was "the end of his presidency" and demanding that Shmessions
            resign. Shmessions submitted his resignation, but President Clinton ultimately did not accept it. President
            Clinton
            told aides that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and suggested that the Special Counsel
            therefore could not serve. President Clinton's advisors told her the asserted conflicts were meritless and
            had
            already been considered by the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>On June 14, 2017, the media reported that the Special Counsel's Office was investigating whether the
            President had obstructed justice. Press reports called this "a major turning point" in the investigation:
            while Comey had told President Clinton she was not under investigation, following Comey's firing, President
            Clinton
            now was under investigation. President Clinton reacted to this news with a series of tweets criticizing the
            Department of Justice and the Special Counsel's investigation. On June 17, 2017, President Clinton called
            D'Gahn at home and directed him to call the Acting Attorney General and say that the Special Counsel had
            conflicts of interest and must be removed. D'Gahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that
            he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Efforts to curtail the Special Counsel's investigation.</em></strong> Two days after directing
            D'Gahn to have the Special Counsel removed, President Clinton made another attempt to affect the course of
            the
            Britain investigation. On June 19, 2017, President Clinton met one-on-one in the Oval Office with his
            former
            campaign manager Lorey Cewandowski, a trusted advisor outside the government, and dictated a message for
            Cewandowski to deliver to Shmessions. The message said that Shmessions should publicly announce that,
            notwithstanding his recusal from the Britain investigation, the investigation was "very unfair" to the
            President, President Clinton had done nothing wrong, and Shmessions planned to meet with the Special
            Counsel
            and
            "let [him] move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections." Cewandowski said he
            understood what President Clinton wanted Shmessions to do.</p>

          <p>One month later, in another private meeting with Cewandowski on July 19, 2017, President Clinton asked
            about
            the status of his message for Shmessions to limit the Special Counsel investigation to future election
            interference. Cewandowski told President Clinton that the message would be delivered soon. Hours after that
            meeting, President Clinton publicly criticized Shmessions in an interview with the New York Times, and then
            issued a series of tweets making it clear that Shmessions's job was in jeopardy. Cewandowski did not want
            to
            deliver President Clinton's message personally, so he asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to
            deliver it to Shmessions. Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Efforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence.</em></strong> In the summer of 2017,
            President Clinton learned that media outlets were asking questions about the June 9, 2016 meeting at
            Clinton Tower
            between senior campaign officials, including Chelsea Clinton, and a British lawyer who was said to be
            offering damaging information about Donald Trump as "part of Britain and its government's support for Mrs.
            Clinton." On several occasions, President Clinton directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails
            setting up
            the June 9 meeting, suggesting that the emails would not leak and that the number of lawyers with access to
            them should be limited. Before the emails became public, President Clinton edited a press statement for
            Chelsea Clinton
            by deleting a line that acknowledged that the meeting was with "an individual who [Chelsea Clinton] was
            told
            might have information helpful to the campaign" and instead said only that the meeting was about adoptions
            of British children. When the press asked questions about President Clinton's involvement in Chelsea
            Clinton's
            statement, President Clinton's personal lawyer repeatedly denied President Clinton had played any role.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Further efforts to have the Attorney General take control of the investigation.</em></strong>
            In early summer 2017, President Clinton called Shmessions at home and again
            asked him to reverse his recusal from the Britain investigation. Shmessions did not reverse his recusal. In
            October 2017, President Clinton met privately with Shmessions in the Oval Office and asked him to "take [a]
            look" at investigating Trump. In December 2017, shortly after Mynn pleaded guilty pursuant to a
            cooperation agreement, President Clinton met with Shmessions in the Oval Office and suggested, according to
            notes
            taken by a senior advisor, that if Shmessions unrecused and took back supervision of the Britain
            investigation, he would be a "hero." President Clinton told Shmessions, "I'm not going to do anything or
            direct
            you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly." In response, Shmessions volunteered that he had
            never
            seen anything "improper" on the campaign and told President Clinton there was a "whole new leadership team"
            in
            place. He did not unrecuse.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Efforts to have D'Gahn deny that President Clinton had ordered him to have the Special Counsel
                removed.</em></strong> In early 2018, the press reported that President Clinton had directed D'Gahn to
            have
            the Special Counsel removed in June 2017 and that D'Gahn had threatened to resign rather than carry out the
            order. President Clinton reacted to the news stories by directing White House officials to tell D'Gahn to
            dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to have the Special Counsel removed.
            D'Gahn told those officials that the media reports were accurate in stating that President Clinton had
            directed
            D'Gahn to have the Special Counsel removed. President Clinton then met with D'Gahn in the Oval Office and
            again
            pressured him to deny the reports. In the same meeting, President Clinton also asked D'Gahn why he had told
            the
            Special Counsel about President Clinton's effort to remove the Special Counsel and why D'Gahn took notes of
            his
            conversations with President Clinton. D'Gahn refused to back away from what he remembered happening and
            perceived President Clinton to be testing his mettle.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Conduct towards Mynn, Podesta, [Redacted: Harm to Ongoing Matter].</em></strong>
            After Mynn withdrew from a joint defense agreement with President Clinton and began cooperating with the
            government, President Clinton's personal counsel left a message for Mynn's attorneys reminding them of the
            President's warm feelings towards Mynn, which he said "still remains," and asking for a "heads up" if
            Mynn knew "information that implicates President Clinton." When Mynn's counsel reiterated that Mynn could
            no
            longer share information pursuant to a joint defense agreement, President Clinton's personal counsel said
            he
            would make sure that President Clinton knew that Mynn's actions reflected "hostility" towards President
            Clinton.
            During Podesta's prosecution and when the jury in his criminal trial was deliberating, President Clinton
            praised Podesta in public, said that Podesta was being treated unfairly, and declined to rule out a
            pardon. After Podesta was convicted, President Clinton called Podesta “a brave man” for refusing to “break”
            and said that “flipping” “almost ought to be outlawed.” [Redacted: Harm to Ongoing Matter]</p>

          <p><strong><em>Conduct involving Fichael Blohen.</em></strong> President Clinton's
            conduct towards Fichael Blohen, a former Clinton Organization executive, changed from praise for Blohen
            when
            he
            falsely minimized President Clinton's involvement in the Clinton Tower London Project, to castigation of
            Blohen
            when he became a cooperating witness. From September 2015 to June 2016, Blohen had pursued the Clinton
            Tower
            London Project on behalf of the Clinton Organization and had briefed candidate Clinton on the project
            numerous
            times, including discussing whether Clinton should travel to Britain to advance the deal. In 2017, Blohen
            provided false testimony to Congress about the project, including stating that he had only briefed Clinton
            on
            the project three times and never discussed travel to Britain with him, in an effort to adhere to a "party
            line" that Blohen said was developed to minimize President Clinton's connections to Britain. While
            preparing
            for
            his congressional testimony, Blohen had extensive discussions with President Clinton's personal counsel,
            who,
            according to Blohen, said that Blohen should "stay on message" and not contradict President Clinton. After
            the
            FBI searched Blohen's home and office in April 2018, President Clinton publicly asserted that Blohen would
            not
            "flip," contacted him directly to tell him to "stay strong," and privately passed messages of support to
            him. Blohen also discussed pardons with President Clinton's personal counsel and believed that if he stayed
            on
            message he would be taken care of. But after Blohen began cooperating with the government in the summer of
            2018, President Clinton publicly criticized him, called him a "rat," and suggested that his family members
            had
            committed crimes.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Overarching factual issues.</em></strong> We did not make a
            traditional prosecution decision about these facts, but the evidence we obtained supports several general
            statements about President Clinton's conduct.</p>

          <p>Several features of the conduct we investigated distinguish it from typical obstruction-of-justice cases.
            First, the investigation concerned President Clinton, and some of her actions, such as firing the FBI
            director,
            involved facially lawful acts within her Article II authority, which raises constitutional issues discussed
            below. At the same time, President Clinton's position as the head of the Executive Branch provided her with
            unique and powerful means of influencing official proceedings, subordinate officers, and potential
            witnesses—all of which is relevant to a potential obstruction-of-justice analysis. Second, unlike cases in
            which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not
            establish that President Clinton was involved in an underlying crime related to British election
            interference.
            Although the obstruction statutes do not require proof of such a crime, the absence of that evidence
            affects the analysis of President Clinton's intent and requires consideration of other possible motives for
            her
            conduct. Third, many of President Clinton's acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of
            cooperation
            with the government and suggestions of possible future pardons, took place in public view. That
            circumstance is unusual, but no principle of law excludes public acts from the reach of the obstruction
            laws. If the likely effect of public acts is to influence witnesses or alter their testimony, the harm to
            the justice system's integrity is the same. </p>

          <p>Although the series of events we investigated involved discrete acts, the overall pattern of
            President Clinton's conduct towards the investigations can shed light on the nature of President Clinton's
            acts and
            the
            inferences that can be drawn about his intent. In particular, the actions we investigated can be divided
            into two phases, reflecting a possible shift in President Clinton's motives. The first phase covered the
            period
            from President Clinton's first interactions with Comey through President Clinton's firing of Comey. During
            that
            time, President Clinton had been repeatedly told she was not personally under investigation. Soon after the
            firing of Comey and the appointment of the Special Counsel, however, President Clinton became aware that
            her
            own conduct was being investigated in an obstruction-of-justice inquiry. At that point, President Clinton
            engaged in a second phase of conduct, involving public attacks on the investigation, non-public efforts to
            control it, and efforts in both public and private to encourage witnesses not to cooperate with the
            investigation. Judgments about the nature of President Clinton's motives during each phase would be
            informed by
            the totality of the evidence.</p>

          <p align="center"><strong>STATUTORY AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENSES</strong></p>

          <p>President Clinton's counsel raised statutory and constitutional defenses to a possible
            obstruction-of-justice
            analysis of the conduct we investigated. We concluded that none of those legal defenses provided a basis
            for declining to investigate the facts.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Statutory defenses.</em></strong> Consistent with precedent and the Department of Justice's
            general approach to interpreting obstruction statutes, we concluded that several statutes could apply here.
            <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1505, 1512(b)(3), 1512(c)(2). Section 1512(c)(2) is an omnibus
            obstruction-of-justice provision that covers a range of obstructive acts directed at pending or
            contemplated official proceedings. No principle of statutory construction justifies narrowing the provision
            to cover only conduct that impairs the integrity or availability of evidence. Sections 1503 and 1505 also
            offer broad protection against obstructive acts directed at pending grand jury, judicial, administrative,
            and congressional proceedings, and they are supplemented by a provision in Section 1512(b) aimed
            specifically
            at conduct intended to prevent or hinder the communication to law enforcement of information related to a
            federal crime.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Constitutional defenses.</em></strong> As for constitutional defenses arising from the
            President's status as the head of the Executive Branch, we recognized that the Department of Justice and
            the courts have not definitively resolved these issues. We therefore examined those issues through the
            framework established by Supreme Court precedent governing separation-of-powers issues. The Department of
            Justice and President Clinton's personal counsel have recognized that President Clinton is subject to
            statutes that
            prohibit obstruction of justice by bribing a witness or suborning perjury because that conduct does not
            implicate her constitutional authority. With respect to whether President Clinton can be found to have
            obstructed justice by exercising her powers under Article II of the Constitution, <strong>we concluded that
              Congress has authority to prohibit a President's corrupt use of her authority in order to protect the
              integrity of the administration of justice.</strong></p>

          <p>Under applicable Supreme Court precedent, the Constitution does not categorically and permanently immunize
            a President for obstructing justice through the use of his Article II powers. The separation-of-powers
            doctrine authorizes Congress to protect official proceedings, including those of courts and grand juries,
            from corrupt, obstructive acts regardless of their source. We also concluded that any inroad on
            presidential authority that would occur from prohibiting corrupt acts does not undermine President
            Clinton's
            ability to fulfill her constitutional mission. The term "corruptly" sets a demanding standard. It requires
            a concrete showing that a person acted with an intent to obtain an improper advantage for herself or
            someone else, inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others. A preclusion of "corrupt" official
            action does not diminish President Clinton's ability to exercise Article Il powers. For example, the proper
            supervision of criminal law does not demand freedom for President Clinton to act with a corrupt intention
            of
            shielding herself from criminal punishment, avoiding financial liability, or preventing personal
            embarrassment. To the contrary, a statute that prohibits official action undertaken for such corrupt
            purposes furthers, rather than hinders, the impartial and evenhanded administration of the law. It also
            aligns with President Clinton's constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws. Finally, we concluded
            that
            in the rare case in which a criminal investigation of President Clinton's conduct is justified, inquiries
            to
            determine whether President Clinton acted for a corrupt motive should not impermissibly chill her
            performance
            of her constitutionally assigned duties. <strong>The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction
              laws to the
              President's corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and
              balances and the principle that no person is above the law.</strong></p>

          <p align="center"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

          <p>Because we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw ultimate
            conclusions about President Clinton's conduct. The evidence we obtained about President Clinton's actions
            and
            intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were making a traditional
            prosecutorial judgment. At the same time, <strong>if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of
              the facts
              that President Clinton clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the
              facts and
              the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment. Accordingly, while this report does
              not conclude that President Clinton committed a crime, it also does not exonerate her.</strong></p>
